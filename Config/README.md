# Config Recorder Customisation for Autobat Labs

This section of the repository supports the [Lab Foundation – Control Tower](https://www.autobat.com.au/page/lab-foundation--control-tower) setup documented on the Autobat Industries website. It focuses on managing the cost and noise generated by AWS Config and Security Hub in a lab environment.

## Overview

AWS Config provides a detailed view of your AWS resources, their configurations, relationships, and how they change over time. It’s also a key dependency for Security Hub controls. But enabling everything by default can quickly lead to high costs and an overwhelming volume of alerts—especially in a lab setting.

To support flexible, secure experimentation, I’ve added two options for managing Config more efficiently.

## Included Code

### 1. `minimal-config-recorder.yaml`
Overrides the default configuration recorder created by AWS Control Tower. This version limits the scope of recorded resources and reduces evaluation frequency to help reduce cost.

### 2. `dev-config-recorder.yaml`
A small-footprint recorder designed for development environments. Use this to test out specific compliance rules without turning on full-scale config tracking.

## Usage

Deploy either CloudFormation template into your target account using the AWS Console or CLI. These templates can be safely run alongside existing Control Tower environments, and are meant to override—not conflict with—the default config setup.

Be sure to adjust parameters as needed for your environment.
